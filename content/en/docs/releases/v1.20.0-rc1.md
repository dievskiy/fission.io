## Features

### Ability to retain specialised pods for poolmanager functions

Fission now supports retaining specialised pods for poolmanager functions. This is useful if you want retain specialized pods and reduce cold start time for critical functions. We have added `retainPods` field in Function CRD to pass the value. Also, we have added CLI flag `--retainpods` to pass the value.
This should work along with `requestsPerPod` and `concurrency` fields in Function CRD.

### Fission Helm Chart Changes

- Fixed issue when `defaultNamespace` and Fission chart release namespaces are same. This issue causes duplicate roles in release namespace for router. [#2856](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2856)
- Namespace environment variables were missing for various services. This issue is fixed now. [#2828](https://github.com/fission/fission/pull/2828)

## Deprecations

## Kubernetes Version Support

Fission 1.20.0-rc1 supports Kubernetes versions 1.23 and above. We have dropped support for Kubernetes versions 1.19 and below.

## Removed

### Fission Controller Removal

We have removed Fission controller from Fission installation. If you have been using Fission controller, please use alternative Kubernetes APIs to manage Fission resources.
